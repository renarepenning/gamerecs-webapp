        <td>We were in the planning stages of both the algorithm and UI. We weren't sure if we would make a website or app yet. We did think it best to start with a KNN algorithm, but we wouldn't begin developmemnt on this until much later. For now our focus was learning and planning, creating a loose timeline and organizing our ideas and time.</td>

        <td>MS 2</td>
        <td>At this point, we understood our most important task was to collect as much data as possible. This was difficult at first, as we wanted specifically user and game interactions as our data. A simple average score combined with the number of reviews would not be substantial. We eventually wanted to create user profiles populated by their input games. To get data similar to this we would need individual ratings by separate users.</td>

        <td>We were able to succesfully scrape thousands of entries of useful data for our algorithm, but now we needed to focus development on the algorithm. Matt and Kelly headlined this effort, making substantial progress on the code. By the end of this milestone we had a working KNN implementation ready for testing and training.</td>

        <td>MS 5</td>
        <td>At this time we have developed a running algorithm MVP as well as drafted a homepage through JavaScript. We worked in parallel to continue data collection alongside app development. Throughout the milestone, Rena worked to recreate the site through Django, working with Emily to launch it on Heroku. The Django site features Game and User classes and has SQLite integrated. We were able to access the IGDB data through the API to get a massive dataset spanning across 200,000 games. We plan to get more user generated data before implementing user input within the site.</td>

        <td>MS 6</td>
        <td>For this Milestone we were tasked with presenting the current standings of our project. We decided to do a small presentation before demonstrating our current implementation before the class. Our main focus was to finally connect the algorithm to the site and we were able to successfully showcase both the Django site and the algorithm. With the algorithm now working through the site, our next step was to optimize both, refining the website to make it look more professional while training the algorithm to improve its accuracy.</td>
